# Phylip dotfiles

This repository contains the custom configuration files for my Arch Linux system, installed completely from scratch, without using archinstall, installation assistants, or any automation scripts.

The dotfiles are designed to create a minimalist environment that is efficient and visually appealing.

- `i3` as window manager
- `Alacritty` as terminal emulator
- `Picom` to create effects and visual modifications
- `Fastfetch` to display system information
- `Dunst` to handle notifications
- `Polybar` as customizable status bar
- `Rofi` as application launcher
- `Flameshot` for screenshots
- `Feh` for desktop wallpaper
